# Presentation

## Initiation 
In the past year, I have built several applications for both Android and .Net application environments. Most notable was the website for my wedding. This was a dynamic, responsive website built in .NET, MVC framework with a Code-first approach with Entity Framework and storage in an SQL database. This has lead me to start training to become a full time developer.

## Planning
In March 2020, I started a formal training based on 16 hrs/day spent on development training. I have focussed on online resources for learning C#/.NET and applied my skills in several projects to optimize the learning experience. BMS teammates have helped me with an occasional code review and by answering questions. 


# Projects
## DiceGame / Casino
This project started as a simple one file Console application, but within the training period has grown to an application that supports multiple UI's. The gamelogic is independant of UI and the games can be run through Console, WebApp and WebAPI.

### Learning points
- the difference between using a static class and a class of with you can create and use an instance. 
- main characteristics
  - Encapsulation
  - Inheritance 
  - Polymorphism

## Wiki helper
The current BMS Wiki is published using the DocFX engine to generate HTML webpages based on Markdown files. The structure of Markdown files such as hosted on the TFS or Azure Devops environment does not work with DocFX out of the box. To publish the files, I have built an application that does three things
1) Restructure the hyperlinks to adjust the relative paths for the website
2) Adjust the folderstructure so that DocFX can create 3 separate parts of the Wiki
3) Builds a Table Of Contents in JSON so DocFX can parse it
