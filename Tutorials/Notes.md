# Training notes

## C# structure
### Classes
- a class is a piece of code containing variables and optionally methods.
- a class can be seen as an object blueprint
- a class can be instanciated. this means one can call the class from a piece of code, thereby creating an object from the blueprint. This object can then be used to either save variables (contained within the class) or to execute methods (also contained within the class. This is called creating an instance of a class


### Namespace
- a namespace is a way of creating a specific area wherein classes and methods are names. Although classes and methods must have a unique name within a namespace, Classes and methods defined within a namespace can have a name that also exists outside of the namespace. 
- the full name of a class is namespace.class

### Methods
- a method is a piece of code that can be called, with an optional input. It will perform a function and return a value.
